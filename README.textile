Quickie is a 'quicklaunch' bar based off "LibDataBroker-1.1":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1 and "Auctioneer's":http://auctioneeraddon.com Slidebar.
It is meant to be a common place for addons to register simple config-launching buttons, or other basic buttons.
Basically a replacement for creating a minimap button (herpes) or fubar plugin that does nothing more than open your addon's config.

h2. Adding support to your addon

The key design point of LibDataBroker is to implement the "Model, View, Controller" design in WoW.
This allows an addon to send out data, an OnClick action... all sorts of things, while remaining independent of the addon displaying the data or using the OnClick.
In short, this means an addon can provide data to display on FuBar without *requiring* FuBar to be present.
If the user doesn't have an addon to display the data, they are not bothered by stuff they don't want to see.

Along this line, we can implement buttons to open addon configs easily, without the need to embed a bunch of libraries to render frames for us.
If the user wishes to have access to the buttons, they need only install a display addon (like this one).
This also means many different display addons could be made, each addressing a certain design, and the user has the control of which design they use.
User choice is a good thing, I've been told.

So enough rambing, how do I add this into my addon?  2 simple steps:
# Add the embed libs into your addon.  You need "LibStub":http://www.wowwiki.com/LibStub, "CallbackHandler-1.0":http://www.wowace.com/wiki/CallbackHandler-1.0 and "LibDataBroker-1.1":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1
#* If you use Ace3 in your addon, you might already have the first two embeds.  Just make sure they're loaded before LibDataBroker.
# Add a "dataobject" to LibDataBroker containing an icon, an OnClick function, and "launcher" set to true
#* launcher" tells display addons that you do not provide any "data" to be rendered, simply an OnClick action to attach to a frame.

h3. Example:

<pre>
LibStub:GetLibrary("LibDataBroker-1.1"):NewDataObject("MyAddonName", {
	launcher = true,
	icon = "Interface\\Icons\\Spell_Nature_StormReach",
	OnClick = function(clickedframe, button) InterfaceOptionsFrame_OpenToFrame(myconfigframe) end,
})
</pre>
