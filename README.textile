Quickie is a "quicklaunch" bar based off LibDataBroker-1.1 and Auctionner's Slidebar.
It is meant to be a common place for addons to register simple config-launching buttons, or other basic buttons.
Basically a replacement for creating a minimap button (herpes) or fubar plugin that does nothing more than open your addon's config.

Exapmles on how to register a button in your own addon will be added soon.
